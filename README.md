# AndroidPushkarSquare
Pushkar Square is a playing cards game. There is a 4×4 board and a single card under the board that you have to choose empty place in the board to put it in, then the next card will open and so on. In short, the goal is to fill the board’s frame in that way:

Jack, Queen and King:

You can only put these cards in their place, when:
  *	Kings in corners
  *	Queens between the corners on the sides
  *	Jacks between the corners up and down
Other cards you can put in any empty place.

Full board case:
If your board is full, you can take out:
 *	Ten cards
 *	Pair of two cards that their value together is Ten
(Ace and Nine, Two and Eight…)
Where is nothing more to take out the game continues.

Jokers:
You cen put the joker in any empty place, and replace it by any card.
You win when the frame is full in Jacks, Queens and Kings, no matter what is inside.
You lose when:
 *	You got Jack, Queen or king and there is not place for it.
 *	The board is full and nothing to take out and not Joker to replace.

Good luck!
